- AGI is still one (or more) breakthroughs or paradigm shifts away

- But AI as it is useful and used; and it will be more

- When anyone can generate the same “[[output]],” the difference is in the “branding”

	- And the storytelling skills to take credit and shift blame

	- Which may not change much compared to the current status quo. Take credit from engineers $$\rightarrow$$  take credit from AI. [4D chess](https://bigthink.com/the-present/highest-earning-men-intelligent/) might just upgrade to 5D chess.

- AI will not replace workers easily. Thought experiment:
  collapsed:: true
	- An alien lands on Earth:
	  * He looks just like a regular man.
	  * He has knowledge for intergalactic travel.
	  * He wants to build a ship to leave Earth.
	  * He does not mind sharing his knowledge, to finish the ship faster.
	  
	  
	  However, he has no certification, connections, [track record, credibility](((63ea4ea3-276d-4e6d-a493-6119ef6057ef))), or a good knowledge of how human societies work. He is just an engineer, and a nerd. His explanations make him look like a lunatic. His schematics are not understandable, or believable.
	  
	  Will he get funding or any help?
	- Personal [[opinion]]: The alien would not get any help before building a _persuasive_ [[PoT]].
	- Similarly, AI cannot get anything effectually done, without a persuasive human presenter, i.e. ([[centaur AI]])
	- Individual contributors working along AI may replace entire teams with the gained productivity, though.
