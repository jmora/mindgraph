	  > X : You seem negative about ChatGPT and its impact.
	  > Me : Quite the opposite. ChatGPT is not a thinking machine but it's a very good stochastic parrot. That has huge potential.
	  > X : Such as?
	  > Me : Management consultants, executives, thought leaders, marketing, lobbyists etc etc.
	  > X : How about [[research]]?
	  > Me : If it's the "let us run a survey to ask a bunch of IT execs what the future is" then sure. You might as well get that from statistical text analysis of internet publications.
	  > X : What wouldn't you trust ChatGPT with?
	  > Me : Most things i.e. anything that requires thought and understanding of [[context]].
	  > X : Such as?
	  > Me : Design a 10kW solar installation for my home.X : You seem negative about ChatGPT and its impact.
	  > X : We could train a task specific AI for that.
	  > Me : Sure, but that's not ChatGPT and the cost of training such a model given the need for installers is questionable.
	  > X : We could use robots.
	  > Me : At some point in the future, maybe.	  
	  > X : So where would you focus?	  
	  > Me : Start with something that is costly, questionable value, often has a poor understanding of context and mostly uses internet resources 
	  > X : ?
	  > Me : Management consultants. ChatGPT should be your executive / management co-pilot.

	  > X :So? Think big?	  
	  > Me : Think big? Ok, the dream of AI is working calendars between Google, Microsoft and Apple.
	  > X : See, you are negative about ChatGPT.	  
	  > Me : Nope, it has its uses. However, that said every boardroom ppt deck will now have ChatGPT added (where Blockchain used to be) for companies still running their own data centres.	  
	  > X : Does this apply to consultants that have genuinely niche skills or do you see ChatGPT also eating that lunch as well?	  
	  > Me : I'm more talking about the big name managment consultancy firms and their "frameworks". Think Robots replacing Robots.	  
	  > X : What's with the Darth Vader references?	  
	  > Me : Many new CIOs have a bit of Darth Vader about them.	  
	  > X : Determined focus?	  
	  > Me : Yearn for an all encompassing, solves everything, empire budget breaking Death Star (nee platform) project ... until it explodes.	  
	  > X : Death star?	  
	  > Me : Boiling frogs.	  
	  > X : Is this a new language?	  
	  > Me : Go read - [GCHQ — Boiling frogs](https://github.com/gchq/BoilingFrogs) by [@GCHQ](https://twitter.com/GCHQ) ... it is still just as relevant today.
	  > X : Why management consultants?	  
	  > Me : Two reasons. Firstly, when it comes to cost, ability and acceptability then there are far more effective examples for replacement [blog.gardeviance.org/2016/04/the-ro…](https://blog.gardeviance.org/2016/04/the-robots-are-coming-for-whom-bell.html) - than the usual suspects of engineers, call centre staff, nurses etc.	  
	  > Me : Secondly. I don't like big name management consultancy firms. I'm happy to put the boot in. However, I see that [@MazzucatoM](https://twitter.com/MazzucatoM) and [@RosieCollingto](https://twitter.com/RosieCollingto) have a far more eloquent book coming out - [Big Consulting Businesses Infantilizes Governments](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Big-Consulting-Businesses-Infantilizes-Governments/dp/0241573084) ...

	  > Heard a few times that "ChatGPT can generate confident-sounding BS to reply to anything in a meeting or email exchange, so the zero-value-add middle managers should fear for their jobs".
	  >
	     > This is a deep misunderstanding of how those middle managers actually operate. Here's why.
	  >
	  > (and yes, I understand it's a joke. Bear with me.)
	  >
	     > Middle managers are not in the business of generating confident-sounding, fast-talking BS replies. They're in the business of managing their image and relationships to protect their position and advance their careers.
	  >
	  > The ability to expound confidently on any topic that comes their way is a required, but very minor tool in their arsenal.
	  > 
	  > BS-generation is a necessary but absolutely not sufficient condition to have their job.
	  >
	  > ChatGPT is obviously not an automation risk for them. You can't automate what they're doing, because it's fundamentally social and psychological in nature. Their "output" is relationships and power dynamics intangibles -- not language.
	  >
	  > The same is true of many other jobs where BS generation is at play. You see ChatGPT and think, "Hey ChatGPT can sound just like X. Guess we'll automate Xs next!" -- but then you misunderstand what Xs are actually doing.

	  > You mistake the cover for the book.

	  > For instance, the ability to generate confident-sounding BS is obviously not enough to get elected to Congress. It's a necessary, but absolutely not sufficient condition.
	  >
	  > The only kind of "BS" that can genuinely be automated with a LLM is... boilerplate. But here's the thing -- boilerplate that can be automated away is also boilerplate that we could do away with altogether.
	  >
	  > It's accurate that humans generate a lot of BS, and superficially that might sound like something you could do with a LLM... but when people do it, it's always as a tool (among others) in a social game that is completely out of reach for non-humans, and likely always will be.

	- And the storytelling skills to take credit and shift blame
		- > “A serious scholar of leadership, the late James Meindl at SUNY Buffalo concluded after a series of insightful studies that we have no satisfactory theory of effective leadership that is independent of performance. We think we know what good leadership is all about-clarity of vision, communication skills, good judgment, and more-but in fact a wide range of behaviors can be said to fit these criteria. Show me a company that delivers high performance, and I can always find something positive to say about the person in charge- about the clarity of his or her vision, about good communication skills, sound judgment, and integrity. Show me a company that has fallen on hard times, and I can always find some reason to explain why the leader failed.” — The Halo Effect — Phil Rosanzwaig — via [Tom Kerwin](https://twitter.com/tom_d_kerwin/status/1626320861098655746)
	- Which may not change much compared to the current status quo. Take credit from engineers $$\rightarrow$$  take credit from AI. 4D chess might just upgrade to 5D chess.
- AI will not _replace_ workers easily.
  collapsed:: true
  * Workers will still be necessary to “operate the AI.”
  * Less workers may have enough productivity to cover the demand for some goods and services.
  * Spare workforce may produce new goods and services, or solve currently open problems.
	- Thought experiment, an alien lands on Earth:
	  * He looks just like a regular man.
	  * He has knowledge for intergalactic travel.
	  * He wants to build a ship to return to his family.
	  * He is happy about sharing his knowledge, to finish the ship faster.
	  
	  
	  However, he has no certification, connections, [track record, credibility](((63ea4ea3-276d-4e6d-a493-6119ef6057ef))), or a good knowledge of how human societies work. He is just an engineer, and a nerd. His explanations make him look like a lunatic. His schematics are not understandable, or believable.
	  
	  Will he get any funding or any help?
	- Personal [[opinion]]: The alien would not get any help before building a _“persuasive”_ [[PoT]].
	- Similarly, AI cannot get anything effectually done, without a persuasive human presenter, i.e. [[centaur AI]].
	- Some industries like drug discovery have been in [[diminishing returns]] for a long time. AI like AlphaFold may bing the much needed productivity improvements in these areas.
	  * Side note: The economics of drugs and drug discovery are very different across regions, see insulin. Diminishing returns represent different ceilings across regions, but they are always there.
- Individual contributors leveraging AI capabilities may replace entire teams with the gained productivity.
  collapsed:: true
	- Arguably, that is already happening with several technologies, e.g. serverless.
	- In fact, in the computer industry, better hardware has enabled software to do more for developers, so that developers can work at a higher level and get more done in less time, i.e. gain productivity.

	- What is new with AI is providing a new interface that enables everybody to benefit from the productivity gains of the “software revolution.” (More than before…)

- What will the gained productivity be used for?
  collapsed:: true
	- Option A: Better [[quality]] of life standards, sustainability, and greater prevention of: death, disease, suffering, inequality, and wasted human potential (for greater productivity and “[self-actualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-actualization)”). New products and services, and lower cost for the existing ones.
		- BTW: How's that inflation going?
	- Option B: Nonsense, meetings, .
		- [Simon Wardley](https://twitter.com/swardley/status/1247451332740550658):
		  > **X:** Can you describe an average company?
		  > **Me:** Average? Hmmm…  they don't know their users or their needs, lack a systematic mechanism of learning, little to no [[situational awareness]], no [[effective]] means of challenging assumptions being story led, rife with bias and duplication?
		  > **X:** That's an average?
		  > **Me:** As in typical, the norm, what is common… I'd say this was fair. In terms of doctrine, I can even take a guess at across many companies.
		  > **X:** But that doesn't make sense, how can companies survive?
		  > **Me:** It's ok to be hopeless as long as your competitors are. If we all suck then no-one gains an advantage. The problems occur when someone slightly more competent enters the arena.
	- Option C: Both simultaneously: nonsensical meetings trying to find a profitable way to improve the [[quality]] of life for the top 0.001%, expecting it will trickle-down to everybody. “At first, smartphones were a niche market too!”
- AI may be (#speculation will be) a revolution without AGI. But AGI (or human-level AI) is still interesting as a potential future milestone for AI.
- Interestingly, two groups of people perceive AGI in two different ways:
  collapsed:: true
  * A relatively _small_ problem that is not far from being solved, just a few years away.
  * A relatively hard problem that we have not even started to try to solve, indefinitely _far away_ from being solved.
