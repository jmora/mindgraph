- Main problem of Agile: misapplication is orders of magnitude more likely than proper application of the principles. The main source of the problem may be:
  * Agile is born as a reaction against engineering practices that are not appropriate for software engineering.
  * Without the counterweight or bias of the traditional engineering, "agility" overshoots.  
- We may define Agile as an epistemic development [[methodology]]
	- The [[purpose]] is acquiring insight more than creating a product
		- Working software is the starting point and a constant
		- The working software is used to find out the wanted software
		- The working wanted software is the side effect of the last iteration
- Related: [[validate first]], "fail fast"
- Agile allows progress without initial insight, acquiring the insight along the way
	- Good: Write working code, avoid [[Byzantine discussion]]
	- The lack of insight does not prevent the application of agile
	- The insight is not guaranteed at the end of the process, it may be a "useful [[delusion]]"
		- All models are wrong, some are useful
		- But they may not be useful forever ([[inductivist turkey]])
	- The tyranny of agile: If insight is available, it may be ignored, and then agile applied

		- "If you try to do that you are led to a conception of success, which is self-reinforcing, because you do get success in terms of this conception, but it's very different from what's done in the sciences"

- Risks & threats: [[Parkinson's law of triviality]], shallow exploration, [[adding epicycles]], [[cargo cult]] (excessive attention to interfaces), [[underthinking]], [[wicked problem]]s,
  - The misapplication of Agile may jeopardize:
    - Insight, deep thinking, simplicity
