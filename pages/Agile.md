- problem: [[misapplication of agile]] is orders of magnitude more likely than proper application of the principles
- Agile is a [[methodology]] to navigate the [[manifold]] of potential products, without leaving the [[manifold]] of working systems
	- Disadvantages:
	  * Non-working systems may be a shorter (straighter) path to get to the working and wanted system
	  * It is an [[iterative method]], and therefore it may get stuck in local maxima
	- Advantages
	  * Avoids getting lost in non-working systems (indefinite cost and delays)
	  * Helps in the exploration of unknown territory
