- > At a previous company, we had a term called Andre Bugs. Now, I’m not going to name the company. […] What we did was we did flight prices and we had to get child prices for flights. So what he did was he hard coded the percentage of an adult flight that would be for the child price. So somebody would open a bug, saying:
  >> "This flight is wrong."

  > So he'd change the percentage, close the bug. […] And then two days later, someone else would open a new bug, saying:
  >> "This different airline, from a different person this is also wrong."
