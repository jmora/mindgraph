- Some things may work as an [[Asset]] and as a [[Liability]], in net terms, depending on how they are done
	- [[Legacy]] and code are prime examples
	- > “the best code is no code at all. Every new line of code you willingly bring into the world is code that has to be debugged, code that has to be read and understood, code that has to be supported. Every time you write new code, you should do so reluctantly, under duress, because you completely exhausted all your other options.” — Jeff Atwood #quote
	- > “The fastest code is the code which does not run. The code easiest to maintain is the code that was never written.” — Robert Galanakis #quote
- The underlying reason is that nearly everything is both an asset and a liability, when considered in a general perspective, i.e. not an economic perspective
	- Beyond the economic perspective (i.e. cost in money, return in money), some solutions may have additional costs, e.g. freedom, or "independence"
