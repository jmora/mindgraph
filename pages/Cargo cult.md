- Cargo cult may result from misunderstanding:
  * Step 1: a term becomes popular in an area, but it is never properly defined
  * Step 2: the term is exported to other areas, where it is misunderstood
  * Step 3: in the new areas, the new term becomes a buzzword. Everybody is doing that, but nobody really is
