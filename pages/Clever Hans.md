	- > Clever Hans (German: der Kluge Hans; fl. 1907) was a horse that was claimed to have performed arithmetic and other intellectual tasks. After a formal investigation in 1907, psychologist Oskar Pfungst demonstrated that the horse was not actually performing these mental tasks, but was watching the reactions of his trainer. He discovered this artifact in the research methodology, wherein the horse was responding directly to involuntary cues in the body language of the human trainer, who was entirely unaware that he was providing such cues. In honour of Pfungst's study, the anomalous artifact has since been referred to as the Clever Hans effect and has continued to be important knowledge in the observer-expectancy effect and later studies in animal cognition.
- Interestingly, if the trainer provided the cues for the wrong answer, Clever Hans would have provided the same wrong answer, both would have been wrong, and both would have been happy about it (Clever Hans would get the sugar cube just the same, no reason to not be happy)
	- Iterate fast enough on a complex domain, and getting a wrong solution is more likely than reaching the right solution, see [[Agile]]
- AI and software in general may display the Clever Hans effect, e.g. finding spurious correlations
