- [[Clojure]] (and Lisp, but I won't make a separate node for Lisp) is an interesting programming language
  * Referred to as "alien technology", the syntax in the lisp family of languages has stood the test of time
  * It is not a very prolific family of languages
      * "if it isn't broken, don't fix it"
      * a more familiar syntax is usually preferred for inspiration for new languages
  * IMHO: it shows that familiarity is preferred to other characteristics, like homoiconicity, syntactic [[minimalism]], etc. Perhaps even [[readability]]
