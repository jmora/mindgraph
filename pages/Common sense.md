  > "Good sense is, of all things among men, the most equally distributed; for every one thinks himself so abundantly provided with it, that those even who are the most difficult to satisfy in everything else, do not usually desire a larger measure of this quality than they already possess." -- [Rene Descartes](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/descartes/1635/discourse-method.htm)
- In research, software engineering, businesses, and life in general, common sense is useful and yet disregarded, because it is hard to define, and harder to quantify (as [[Usefulness]] often is)
	- e.g. imagine asking someone their age to keep record of it (assuming GDPR, etc.), this is an example of [[Naive realism]]: the interface must show the age, and the age is collected and added to a cell in a spreadsheet. In fact, the interface should show the age based on the current date and the birthday (hidden reality to naive realism). The current date changes every day, the age changes every year, the birthday does not change normally. An expert in knowledge engineering may write a paper on data [[Quality]], timeliness, immutability, etc. but to avoid this kind of mistakes a PhD in knowledge engineering should not be necessary, common sense _should be_ enough. (Beware of the authority fallacy too).
- We may define common sense in a way similar to [[Artificial general intelligence]]: the kind of knowledge and capabilities for decision making that an average person may have in a normal situation. It requires nothing out of the ordinary, but a complete awareness and flawless utilization of the ordinary is in fact extraordinary in itself. Hence: "common sense is not so common"

- #Conjecture lack of common sense results from a disregard or ignorance of [[Purpose]], [[Situational awareness]], or long term [[Perspective]], resulting in poor judgement, respectively being orthogonal to the purpose, inadequate for the situation, or delayed failure (which may itself materialize in several ways)
	- If this is correct, common sense is achievable by having a clear understanding of the [[Purpose]], the [[Context]] and the sustainability of the approach (see [[Infinite games]]). Note that the first two are part of the [[Strategy]]
	- Without common sense, "knowledge" is only useful to find the best excuses for the worst decisions.

- #Conjecture lack of common sense is not the manifestation of lacking the capability of thinking or acting according to common sense, but instead choosing not to, for comfort, or because the [[Context]] does not help to do so, i.e. it is not a property of the person, but of specific defective actions of that person

	- Rather than accepting countless and unbounded errors, we should be aware of this and fight it daily, just like we shower and brush our teeth daily. Consider it "hygiene", for decision making, thinking, etc.
