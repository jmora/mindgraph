- Be careful with the [[Curse of knowledge]]
- See: [[Asynchronous work]], in particular: ((6255de47-f2a8-4717-a564-d0593da027a3))
- The ideal team size seems to be 5-9 persons, limited by the exponential number of communication channels (Brook's law)
- Communication is especially relevant towards decision makers (see [[Decision making]])

- Communication is particularly challenging between groups with different backgrounds or purposes

- #Conjecture a different local maximum is found in a team size of 1, i.e. achieve decoupling at the individual level, integrate in several layers, not at once

	- In particular, the need of any [[Negotiation]] is eliminated, [[Decision making]] is greatly simplified, any module to replace is easier to replace
- [[Insight]] is not easily transferable from one person to another
	- A background is necessary, ELI5 may only provide limited and shallow insight
	- The speed of communication is important, but it is always limited

	- Capturing the [[Insight]] with a [[Knowledge graph]], which can then be sent in an email is just a dream
