- See also [[Complexity]]
	- Complexity refers to software or models in general
	- Friction refers to processes or workflows done manually, usually users, but analogously developers, or workers in general
		- Consider: platform or tools for internal use
		- Paperwork, overhead, [[Communication]],...
- WRT [[Communication]], consider information friction too:
	- How easily the information flows within the organization, upwards and downwards
	- Not much, result: "autonomy" or "fragmentation"
		- The organization becomes several smaller organizations, and duplication emerges

	- Information is necessary for informed (data-driven) decisions
	- The alternative are uninformed and misinformed decisions: lottery tickets, bets, guesses
		- e.g. Dictator trap
	- If the information friction gets out of control, consider openness and transparency
		- Opening the company to have each of the "fragments" competing in the market. Possible outcomes:
		  * Collaboration, which was impossible: big win, avoiding duplication
		  * Providing services to external customers: additional revenue, huge win
		  * Failing to compete: at least you may now stop trying rather than trying (and failing) n times
		- Do not try to enforce the use of internal subpar platforms, it results in ShadowOps, friction, duplication, and lack of competitiveness, i.e. fragility. It is a way of shooting yourself in the foot
		  * Eat your own dog food if that is your business. Use the feedback:
		      * Improve it, if you are or may be competitive
		      * Discard it, otherwise, better "fail fast"
		  * Otherwise, eat healthy food, and focus on your business
		- "If you are not going to make it good, buy it done from who is willing or capable to"
- Friction causes fragmentation in organizations
  * Friction slows down some parts of the organization
  * Faster parts break away from the slower parts

- If significant enough, the organization is a net liability (not an asset) for workers
