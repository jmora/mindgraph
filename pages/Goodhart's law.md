alias:: metric fixation

- [[Goodhart's law]] is the problem, the solution might be: [an appropriate use of metrics](https://www.martinfowler.com/articles/useOfMetrics.html) ([Patrick Kua](http://thekua.com/atwork)):
  * Explicitly link metrics to goals 
  * Favor tracking trends over absolute numbers 
  * Use shorter tracking periods
  * Change metrics when they stop driving change
- > “A frequent feature of [[metric fixation]] is paying for performance, that is, offering individuals or organizations financial incentives to meet quantifiable criteria. That may work in organizations that exist for the single [[purpose]] of making a profit, though as we'll see, even in these cases it is rarely [[effective]]. It works even less well in organizations in which employees are oriented to a more idealistic mission, such as schools, universities, medical practices, and hospitals. Whenever reward is tied to measured performance, [[metric fixation]] invites gaming.”
