- Here I try to help you to make the most of this zettelkasten, which is not as straightforward as it seems
	- For zettelkasten or wiki style of pages, read at will, follow the links, and if one does not make sense or happens to be a blank page, you may just use the Internet, including asking chatGPT. Usually I assume that the information readily available on the Internet is already known or has no value in repeating it here. Leverage the Internet.
	- For the more guided type of pages (if you have found one), just follow through the links provided, and stay in the path when suitable. The reason to have them here, along with the zettelkasten type of pages is that creating links to expand on some ideas or background is a lot easier. If you need further clarification on some concept and follow a link to the zettelkasten area of the site, consider the previous point of the instructions.
	- If both previous points fail, please feel free to ask me for further help.
	- If you do not know if you are in the guided type of pages or in the zettelkasten part, 90% of the time you are in the zettelkasten part.
- If you are using this on a computer, LogSeq provides out of the box some features and I have not invested time in making them more accessible, sorry for that. Anyways:
  * Press `Ctrl + Shift + p` for a list of commands. The most useful (in my opinion) are the following two:
  * Press `t t` to switch light and dark modes. (I found this theme somewhere, I could have customized it further, butâ€¦ [[opportunity cost]]).
  * Press `t w` to toggle wide mode.
