alias:: [[80/20 rule]]

- Introduction from ChatGPT:
  collapsed:: true
	- the Pareto [[Principle]], also known as the 80/20 rule, suggests that 80% of the results come from 20% of the effort. It’s a common pattern in many areas, where a small portion of inputs often leads to a large portion of outputs.
	  
	  How it applies to work and value creation:
	  * High-leverage work: A small fraction of tasks, the most important or [[efficient]] ones, generate the majority of the value.
	  * [[Diminishing returns]]: After reaching that initial 80% value, the remaining 20% takes disproportionately more effort to achieve.
	  * Prioritization: Focusing on the critical 20% first maximizes impact with minimal wasted effort.
	  
	  **For example,** imagine you're writing a report. The first 20% of your effort might cover the core ideas and structure, which delivers 80% of its value to the reader. The remaining 80% of your time could be spent on fine-tuning, formatting, and minor details—adding polish but not as much additional value.
