- # Past (personal experience)
  * Linguistic action execution (LAE, [[GOFAI]], [MSc thesis](https://oa.upm.es/43591/))
  * Microservice composition
	- ## Undergrad: Linguistic action execution (LAE)
	  * Problem definition:
	      * Detect information in [[natural language]] using expert-defined patterns (linguistic schemata, [[GOFAI]], before [[Deep Learning]])
	      * Use that information to execute some actions, added dynamically with plugins (before REST, and microservices)
	  * The most relevant part are the linguistic schemata, published as [Enhancing the expressiveness of linguistic structures](https://oa.upm.es/id/eprint/19601)
	  * We will see:
	      * LAE architecture
	      * Schemata definition
		- ### Schemata definition

	- ## [[Buying hierarchy]], missing: reliability
	  * ((64b40182-4604-4478-92ef-39365e52e281))
	  * The fast adoption of [[LLMs]] shows the interest for their functionality.
	  *  Reliability is the most pressing need.
	  * They are as convenient as most SaaS, and rapidly integrating in every imaginable application.
	      * As much as big companies like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta cover use cases and services.
