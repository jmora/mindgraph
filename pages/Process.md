- > Seek results, win once. Optimize the process, win repeatedly.
- The process should be the shortest and smoothest path to the desired results or [[Purpose]] of the process
	- Without those constraints, "brute force is enough", or "brute force is all you need", given enough [[Speed]] to explore the entire solution space

		- Agile is often misunderstood as "brute force, efficiently, very fast"
		  collapsed:: true
			- It is implemented in several steps:
			  
			  1. Proceed with the first idea, until it fails, without a "[[Fail fast]]" approach.
			  2. Proceed with the next approach. Not necessarily backtracking to the root.
			  3. On failure, continue backtracking to arbitrary levels. Normally the least necessary, adding epicycles), until the sunk cost makes the current result "acceptable"
			  4. In the postmortem (if any), blame the wrong application of agile. Agile is all you need with more [[Speed]] for a more complete exploration of the solution space with brute force. A better solution would have been found, only if subordinates were not so lazy and slow.

		- Agile is rarely properly understood #TODO
- Optimize for smoothness, i.e. the least friction, the most [[Speed]]
	- #TODO expand on opportunity cost
