- **Avoid** using readability as a metric, unless you have an objective way to measure it
- To the best of my knowledge, readability depends on the familiarity of the reader with the structure of the code: a more complex but more familiar structure will seem more readable than a more simple but less familiar structure. See also [[Clojure]]
	- This is particularly obvious when new syntax forms are introduced in a language or the reader is used to other languages, e.g. list comprehensions in Python compared to Java for loops
	- Similarly, it may impact negatively evolution in terms of paradigms, e.g. OOP vs FP
	- Readability is therefore misleading as a metric, and biased against new (and possibly better) ways to structure the code
- In conclusion: **avoid**
-
