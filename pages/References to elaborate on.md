		- Designing code, APIs, UI, architectures,… is design; there are differences, there are specific skills and knowledge to each, and not all require the same levels of [[attention]] to the same aspects, or the same techniques to find out what is unknown. But they share some [[principles]] like [[simplicity]]

		- Consider from the perspective of cybernetics/AI. Many options: from brute force to direct methods, through iterative methods of optimization. The question is not so much as what is "possible", or what is "enough", but what is "best" or even _"more intelligent"_.

	- Software development is to some extent considered commoditized, and developers replaceable
		- Oftentimes, [[commoditization]] is a delusion resulting from ignoring the differences between providers, or how to measure them
			- See [[information asymmetry]], [[McNamara fallacy]]
			- e.g. in healthcare, many procedures need to be performed manually by surgeons, not being "industrial" but "artisanal" or even "artist" [(i.e.)](https://twitter.com/j_mora/status/1521021673738321921), in a delicate [[context]] small differences may have big consequences
		- In those cases, information asymmetry is worsened by the assumption of commoditization

- Learning, personal/professional development
	- Learning, theory vs practice false dilemma

		- Is coach height correlated with NBA team victories?
		- Learn by practice with no theory: likely to run into bad practices, e.g. bad code reviews: ((6252fea3-b1ba-4a59-85fb-a819643f1f2b))
		- Learn theory and no practice: in the worst case allows for teaching, like a ("lossy") book. In a better case, provides a head start for practice, possibly beyond years of bad practices
		- Best: both
		- Root at misconceptions:
		  * "Use it or lose it": remembering without practicing is not possible
		  * Theory is vague or wrong, "only the real thing allows learning"
		  * Words are only words, and knowledge can only be acquired through practice

	- Poverty mentality related as to potential and opportunities
		- The future is already here, but not equally distributed ([[inequalizer]]). Looking at what happens "in the future that is already here" is hard (to some extent, even impossible), but it is necessary to not fall behind further. Judging the future when not living in the future is hard, which inevitably results in errors. Expand on: decision making, upside and downside, risk, probability, ergodicity, survivorship bias,... See also  [[type I & II errors]]
			- Some cultures, being "not in the future" will reject the perspective gained from being "in the future", this is an [[inequalizer]]. Normally that perspective is considered smoke and mirrors, hot air, etc. The risk is rejecting a true future being too skeptical or close-minded. (Type II error)
			- Some cultures will embrace it, which may be a [[equalizer]] (leapfrog potential), it may also result in greater inequality due to scams, bubbles, and in general risky shortcuts resulting in materialized setbacks, resulting again in an [[inequalizer]]. The risk is accepting a false future being too gullible or naive. (Type I error)

		- A Bay area native will have a perspective that may be hard to acquire for someone out of the Bay area. All models are wrong,  but it is always good to apply more models and see where they lead to (e.g. to contextualize other models): https://evjang.com/2022/04/25/rome.html
