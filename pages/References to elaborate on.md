		- Consider from the perspective of cybernetics/AI. Many options: from brute force to direct methods, through iterative methods of optimization. The question is not so much as what is "possible", or what is "enough", but what is "best" or even _"more intelligent"_.

	- Learning, theory vs practice false dilemma

		- Is coach height correlated with NBA team victories?
		- Learn by practice with no theory: likely to run into bad practices, e.g. bad code reviews: ((6252fea3-b1ba-4a59-85fb-a819643f1f2b))
		- Learn theory and no practice: in the worst case allows for teaching, like a ("lossy") book. In a better case, provides a head start for practice, possibly beyond years of bad practices
		- Best: both
		- Root at misconceptions:
		  * "Use it or lose it": remembering without practicing is not possible
		  * Theory is vague or wrong, "only the real thing allows learning"
		  * Words are only words, and knowledge can only be acquired through practice
		- (yes, this is not a reference, and I perhaps I should elaborate, but I have better things to do)
