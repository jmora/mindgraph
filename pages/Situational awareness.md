- If innovation is about "living in the future", failing at it means living in a future that does not materialize, i.e. a parallel reality. This is a prevalent problem, resulting from a lack of situational awareness ([[Reality check]])
	- #Conjecture as companies are larger and more hierarchical, they experience a problem similar to the vanishing gradient. Without active efforts to counter this phenomenon, inner layers get further from the reality, and lose sight of it, resulting in a [[Delusion]], or parallel reality
		- There are many approaches to address this problem, e.g. see [[Decision making]], with varying degrees of [[Effective]]ness depending on the [[Context]]
- All models are wrong, some are useful. Hammers are useful, but do not fall in love with them
- The problem with many mental models and principles is that they may be situational dependent, and misleading if not applied in the corresponding situation
	- See also [[Quantification]]: Situational awareness may provide a similar result: what is true in one situation is not true in a different one. Two opposite things may both be true, in their corresponding contexts, or to different extents
	- i.e. they may be true, but not the whole truth
