- > “I'm actually as proud of the things we haven't done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying 'no' to 1,000 things. You have to pick carefully.” — Steve Jobs #quote
- Saying "no" may seen negative, no pun intended. But it is necessary
	- e.g. contrary to the "and then" model, consider "drink rat poison _and then_ two liters of water per day"
- Consider in the context of advice:
	- If advice only focuses on what not do to, it leads to confusion: not knowing what to do
	- Advice must explain:
		- **what** to do, and what not to do; as part of a [[Plan]]
		- **why** it should be done, or what is the [[Purpose]], and
		- **when** it should be applied, i.e. the right [[Context]]
		- then it is applicable [[Strategy]], with a limited risk of misunderstanding and misapplication
	- If advice only focuses on what to do, it may lead to perpetuating bad practices, and [[Cargo cult]]: doing some things, without [[Purpose]] (only for signaling or posing), _and then_ doing a lot of things that should not be done
		- e.g. do not be a data charlatan

- Counterintuitively, doing nothing is sometimes better than doing something

	- [[Effective]] >> [[Efficient]]
	- Do the right thing, do the thing right, do the thing fast (to expand on this) #TODO
	- Consider: negative margins or negative ROI of some activities: [[Asset-Liability duality]]
