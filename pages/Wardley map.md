- Similar to an [[ontology]] on a scatter plot.
- Connections have no [[direction]], or label.
	- #opinion I like it, it makes the representation more compact. Ontologies have two parts: TBox and ABox.
	  * Wardley maps are usually only the ABox part
	  * Taxonomy can be represented with boxes (not ideal, but possible), normally horizontal boxes (same class, same vertical value)
	  * Mereology can be represented with borders, normally using background colors
	  * What we see are normally connections between instances, usual labels out of taxonomies and mereologies carry very little semantic load, normally being of the form: “uses”, “informs”, “hasX”, “dependsOn”,…
	  * However, if you are creating a [[Wardley map]] and you think one, several, or all connections would be better off writing the labels, by all means, write them. They are important when they inform a reasoner, e.g. transitive properties, inverse properties, etc.
	  * Wardley maps do not target automatic reasoning, but visual representation for people, who normally can infer the meaning from the [[context]] (domain and range), but… wouldn't they be much better with automatic reasoning capabilities? #speculation
- The movement of evolution is towards the right
	- This is correct for [[town planners]] and [[settlers]]
		- Most of the time they move to the right as they evolve components
		- Occasionally they move to the left to evolve new components or approaches
			- However, see [[Plank's principle]]
	- [[Pioneers]] move to the left, and the landscape moves to the right, as they leave it behind

  * value-evolution
  * cost-time
