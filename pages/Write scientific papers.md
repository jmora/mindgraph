	- I like LaTeX:
	  * It is best for formulas
	  * Plain text allows great version control with GIT
	  * Slides with Beamer may be in the same repository
	  * Figures are supported as plain text with PGF/TikZ
	  * Plain text figures may be imported into slides and papers. [[DRY]] when making changes to them
	  * Defining commands allows higher [[abstraction]]
	  * Good packages for automation, e.g. `cleveref`
	- Some day MDX may support better features: Interactive components (not on PDF), slides and long text format in the same document, better formats than PGF/TikZ, more general purpose libraries for dynamic documents, and whatnot. But as of [[20220911]], those features are not available, AFAIK, and I prefer LaTeX.
