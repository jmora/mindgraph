- Simply: $$\\a\rightarrow b\\\neg b\\\therefore\neg a$$
- Not to be confused with [[deduction]], or “affirming the consequent”, which is not a logical implication but a probabilistic guess, see also: [[Bayes theorem]].
- > “$$^{15}$$Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves. $$^{16}$$ You will know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes from thornbushes or figs from thistles? $$^{17}$$ Even so, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit. $$^{18}$$ A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor *can* a bad tree bear good fruit. $$^{19}$$ Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. $$^{20}$$ Therefore by their fruits you will know them.” — Matthew 7:15-20 #quote
