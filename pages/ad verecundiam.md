- [Wikipedia is fine for this one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority). Interestingly:
  * Its wiki nature may work as an _[[ad populum]]_ [[fallacy]].
  * Not being a primary source (requiring 3rd party sources) works as an *[[ad verecundiam]]* fallacy, when in its wiki nature the 3rd party sources are required to be authoritative.
