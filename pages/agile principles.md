- Note: [[principles]] at the bottom, as described in [Agile Alliance](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/12-principles-behind-the-agile-manifesto/) inspired by the [[lean principles]], worded concisely, and exactly as in the [[Lean]] [[principles]] where possible
	- Important to keep these [[principles]] in mind: the [[misapplication of agile]] is more likely than the proper application of the [[principles]]
- Agile is a [[methodology]] to navigate the [[manifold]] of potential products, without leaving the [[manifold]] of working systems
	- Disadvantages:
	  * Non-working systems may be a shorter (straighter) path to get to the working and wanted system
	  * It is an [[iterative method]], and therefore it may get stuck in local maxima
	- Advantages
	  * Avoids getting lost in non-working systems (indefinite cost and delays)
	  * Helps in the exploration of unknown territory
