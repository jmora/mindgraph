- [Superforecasters](https://fs.blog/ten-commandments-for-superforecasters/) learn when they are mistaken in their predictions. They also learn when they are right. They [[always learn]].
	- It is worth aiming for excellence. If you miss the bullseye, at least you hit the target.
- > My  staff pushed back on me when I made these arguments to them. They said:
  >> “shocks” hit the economy, both demand shocks and supply shocks. Shocks  such as COVID, supply chain disruptions, the Delta wave, the Omicron wave, missing workers, unprecedented fiscal stimulus, and the war in Ukraine. And shocks, by [[definition]], are unforecastable.
  > 
  > That is true, and indeed I recognize that we experienced very unusual shocks. That said, I see a couple problems with dismissing the miss because of shocks.
  > * First, because shocks are unforecastable, it absolves us from needing to learn from this experience and do better in the future.
  > * And second, I believe that even if we had been able to identify all the shocks in advance, I don’t think our workhorse models would have come anywhere close to forecasting 7 percent inflation. 
  >
  > I think the root of our miss is that our models are not currently equipped to forecast the surge pricing inflation we are experiencing.

	- In contrast, _some people_ will find excuses to avoid learning, even when they are hopelessly wrong.

- In [[pathological organizations]], [[postmortem analysis]] will be misused for shifting blame. #conjecture:
  * In healthy organizations, shifting blame results in [[believability]] loss.
  * In [[pathological organizations]], shifting blame results in [[believability]] preservation.
- Similarly, if simply “hitting the target” (or the bare minimum, and not excellence) becomes the [[goal]], and [[postmortem analysis]] focuses on cost reduction for the sake of being more “[[Agile]]”, [[quality]] will degrade until the target is only _arguably_ hit.
	- #opinion: a degradation of [[objectivity]] seems to be a side effect, providing more wiggle room for what is _arguably_ happening.
