- Brief note:
  collapsed:: true
	- My greatest strength in my [[personal background]] is epistemic. Ever since I was a child I was regularly presented with multiple irreconcilable perspectives, and it was up to me to decide:
	  * How can I know to what extent [[perspective]] $$p$$ is true, accurate, [[constructive]], informative, or useful?
	  * What are the implications and second level consequences of [[perspective]] $$p$$ if I choose to act according to it?
	  * Why would [[perspective]] $$p$$ not be correct? Why would someone believe in $$p$$ if evidence points to the contrary?

	- As a child and a student, this leads to an interesting way of learning, much like a [[TMS]], which at the time I thought was what everybody did, naturally.
	  * While the childhood years are often not considered in a professional [[context]], they are a significant number of years, they are impactful, and in my case they were a significant exercise of meta-learning.
	      * Learn: acquire knowledge.
	      * Meta-learn: acquiring knowledge about knowledge acquisition, e.g. reliability of the [[process]] and the acquired knowledge. 
	  * A lot may be “overwritten” later on, judging a person by their past is dicey.
	      * More so when considering the past is more distant.
	      * More so when they were not adults and their mental development was not finished.
	  * Therefore, it may be perceived from a number of perspectives, from fundamental and foundational, to misleading and deceitful, all the way through irrelevant and meaningless. You choose your [[perspective]], or not — remember: [[TMS]].
- Professionally, I worked on [[GOFAI]] first, in academia, where I had first hand experience with undecidability, [infinite dead ends]([[infinite dead end]]), and [[formal research]].
- Then I worked on data science, [[machine learning]], and deep learning, in industry, more in an [[applied research]] setting than an [[empirical research]] setting.
- With my previous background I was able to see organisations as learning machines — I was not able to “unsee” it. Probably there are better paths towards [[cybernetics]]. This one just happens to be my path.
