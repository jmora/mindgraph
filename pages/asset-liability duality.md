- Some things may work as an [[asset]] and as a [[liability]], in net terms, depending on how they are done
	- [[legacy]] and code are prime examples

	- ((635941c8-62c6-474f-9c6a-f18af506ca82))
- The underlying reason is that nearly everything is both an asset and a liability, when considered in a general perspective, i.e. not an economic perspective
	- Beyond the economic perspective (i.e. cost in money, return in money), some solutions may have additional costs, e.g. freedom, or "independence"

- See [[opportunity cost]], [[Boots theory]]
- The threshold separating net [[asset]] from net [[liability]] is often [[quality]]
- To address the [[asset-liability duality]] choose [[quality before quantity]]
