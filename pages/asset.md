alias:: liability

- In the most general sense (the one I use):
	- An [[asset]] is something that _provides_ more of some resource repeatedly.
	- A [[liability]] is something that _requires_ more of some resource repeatedly.
- Reminder: the most valuable resource: time
- If a programmer is a machine that turns coffee into code, it is both:
  * a coffee sink — [[liability]] for coffee
  * a code source — [[asset]] for code
  
  code source not to be confused with source code :|
