- Examples:
  * Hard work, smart work.
  * Investment: [[relative]] return, amount.
  * Panda models, caviar models. -- Andrew Ng
  * Fast iteration, careful iteration.
  * Leverage computation, vs leverage human knowledge.
  * Waterfall, [[Agile]].
  * Theory, practice.
  * Think vs experiment. (second [[bitter lesson]] [Fran√ßois Chollet](https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/1611286048084041728))
  * System 1, system 2.
  * [[Quality]], quantity.

	- Bayesian vs Frequentist: e.g. balls in a bag are:
	  * 9 red, 1 white: there is wrong and there is right, try better.
	  * 90% red, 10% white: there is indetermination and randomness, try more.
	  How many balls may we extract to get the white one? Is it worth trying to find out more?
	  * We may extract all balls: no reason to find out more or strategize.
	  * We may extract only one: strategize, e.g. in this case try to feel differences between them within the bag (theory) before extraction (practice).

	- "The era of abundance." -- How many tries are available? How many tries may succeed? (global vs local optima)
		- If ROI was sustainable, abundance would bring more abundance, see the example on investment.
		- If abundance implies less ROI (more recall, less precision, same ROC), it is unsustainable, a bubble that pops.
		  * Avoid the [[false dilemma]]: always consider to improve the ROC.
	- Principal-agent problem: cost of attempts for principal, merit of success for agent. Result: Maximization of [[opportunity cost]], minimization of [[strategy]].
- An example is hard vs smart work:
  collapsed:: true
  $$result = hard \times smart$$
	- If either side is zero, the result is zero. It is a two-sided problem.
	- But only smart may be intuitively negative, producing a negative [[outcome]]. It is an asymmetric problem.
	- Hard work is important, after it is smart. If wrongly assuming smart: backfire.
	- [[asset-liability duality]]
	  collapsed:: true
		- ((63bbb0a8-5d98-4f0e-a8cf-204eca9ef80d))
	- In this case:
	  * Smart work should take precedence.
	  * Only after hitting [[diminishing returns]] in smartness, hard work should be the priority.
	  * It may be seen more clearly with investment opportunities
	- Reminder: work is an investment of force to produce some change:
	  $$W = \int_{t_1}^{t_2}\mathbf{F} \times \mathbf{v} \, dt = \int_{t_1}^{t_2}\mathbf{F} \times \tfrac{d\mathbf{s}}{dt} \, dt =\int_C \mathbf{F} \times d\mathbf{s}$$
	  * The force may be too small to beat inertia or friction, or it may be larger.
	  * The direction may be correct, approximate, zero (perpendicular), or wrong (opposite direction), it may be negative. It takes precedence.

- Investment may be a clearer example:
  collapsed:: true
  $$absoluteReturn = relativeReturn \times amount$$
	- In this case:
	  * The [[relative]] return may be negative.
	  * The amount implies a [[opportunity cost]] (and a challenge).
	  * The point is the maximal absolute return, with the minimal cost. 
	  * The [[relative]] return takes precedence when evaluating investors.
	  * The amount managed is secondary, and only relevant because larger amounts result in additional challenges (higher [[relative]] returns are considered more difficult).
	  * Also to be considered: [[risk]], consistency, and period of time. Related: [[process]] vs [[output]], [[outcome]] vs [[systems]].
- Theory first vs practice first
  collapsed:: true
	- Theory first is slow, slow is smooth, smooth is fast.
	  * Define the problem, define the theory, prove the solution. Learn in the [[process]].
	  * Build the solution. Learn in the [[process]].
	  * Empirically evaluate the solution. Find limitations. Learn in the [[process]]. Go to 1.
	- Practice first: prone to errors and going back to square 1.
	  * Build a new prototype.
	  * Patch the prototype.
	  * When it cannot be patched, go to 1.
- Iterate faster vs iterate better (extract more knowledge from each iteration).
	-
	- Extremes:
	  * 1 shot, bullseye, one try.
	  * [[brute force]]: try everything.
	  * nothing to learn (randomness, luck): lottery, gambling.
-
- Example: SpaceX, several attempts for initial launch, budget for a last one. Batman, pit, rope, jump.
  * If it is not the last attempt: the [[purpose]] is learning.
  * If it is the last attempt: no point in learning, failing is failing.
  Counterpoint: [[always learn]], [[exhaust theory]]
