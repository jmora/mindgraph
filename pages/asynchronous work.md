- manager time, maker time

- Asynchronous work uses written [[communication]] primarily, this is especially relevant in terms of:
	- Being in the same page, i.e. having a common understanding or perspective, e.g. diagrams for [[situational awareness]]: in the [[organization]] for the people, in the [[process]] for the efforts that may be defined as a process, e.g. org chart, [[Wardley map]], a [[Kanban board]], [[CRISP-DM]],...
	- Documentation
		- Which should elaborate on:
			- Decisions made, and rationale for those decisions
			- Commitments about goals not achieved yet or SLAs to be maintained
			- Situational awareness (as described above)
			- High level overview of the documented thing, to find your way easily in it
			- The usually expected documentation, in addition to the previous
		- Perhaps worth mentioning, the [[purpose]] of documentation is multiple:
			- Boarding new members and helping them to get to speed
			- Provide a real-time updated perspective
			- Provide a single source of truth, every "report" or similar information to be produced should come from a single documentation source, avoiding inconsistencies, updating only once (less overhead), and detecting errors more easily (more reads per write). Having several sources of truth eventually produces inconsistencies.
			- #speculation updates in the documentation and notifications on them are enough for all [[communication]]. The discussion and [[process]] for [[decision making]] should be made explicit similarly, allowing for new members to understand not only _how_ things are but _why_.
	- #speculation written communication might help against the [[Parkinson's law of triviality]]
- It is especially indicated in the case of [[remote work]]
