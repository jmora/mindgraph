	- The [[process]] for choosing people should be systematically built out and evidence-based.
	  
	  > Make finding the right people systematic and scientific
	  
	  You need to have a people-hiring machine in which the goals are clearly stated so that the [[outcomes]] can be compared with them and the machine (the design and the people) producing the [[outcomes]] can evolve to improve.
	  
	  Organizations typically hire people by having job candidates' resumes reviewed by semi-random people based on semi-random criteria which leads them to invite in candidates to have semi-random groups of people ask the candidates semi-random questions and then make their choices of whom to offer jobs based on the consensus of how they liked them.
	  
	  You need to make sure that each one of those steps is done more systematically and purposefully.
	  
	  For example, you should think through what questions are asked and how the different answers candidates give differentiate them in the ways that you are seeking to differentiate them.
	  
	  You should also save all of those answers so you can learn about how indicative they might be of subsequent behaviors and performance.
	  
	  I do not mean that the human dimension or art of the hiring [[process]] should be eliminated--the personal values and esprit de corps part of a relationship are critically important and can't be fully measured by data.
	  
	  Sometimes the twinkle in the eye and the facial expressions are telling.
	  
	  However, even for those areas where people's [[subjective]] interpretations are important, you can still use data and a scientific approach to be more [[objective]]--for example, you can capture data to assess the track records of those making the interpretations.
- Absolutely right! In general, everything should be as systematic and scientific as possible. But _here be dragons_:
	- False positives: hard to detect, incentive misalignment. Are you detecting false positives? Or are you detecting the people that were easier to throw under the bus? Are machiavelians finding escape goats for their mistakes?
	- False negatives: harder to detect. How is that data being collected? [[Risk]]: survivorship bias
	- Related: see grid search, random search, Bayesian search — grid search is more systematic, not the best option
- Alternative to intelligent design: evolution. E.g. natural selection at the [[two-pizza team]] level — is that wasteful?
- Take-home message
  * Beware of pseudoscience
  * Systematic is good for good moves, and it is bad for bad moves (error cancellation is avoided with consistent mistakes)
