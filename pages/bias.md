alias:: fallacy

- [[Bias]] and [[fallacy]] are two different things, but they are “close enough” to share a tag. [[IMHO]].
- For me the actual category is “human bug” — the “human reasoning algorithm” produces wrong results. Those are the words you can find in the dictionary, though.
- I will use [[bias]] most often just because it is the shorter word.
