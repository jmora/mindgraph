- Definition: Catastrophic failure is a failure from which recovering is not possible. It may provide lessons to learn, but the learning is ultimately useless because no more attempts are possible.
- [[Catastrophic failure]] is always preventable, either by:
  * [acquiring knowledge]([[embracing ignorance]]) before trying
  * trying [strategically]([[strategy]]) ([[validate first]])
  * [not trying]([[subtraction]])
