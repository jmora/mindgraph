- Do not confuse with [[simplicity]], we may preserve the [[simplicity]] of some code and completely destroy its clarity, e.g.
  * Number the lines of code, display the number
  * Randomly sort the lines while keeping the number
  * Both pieces of software (before and after sorting randomly) have the same [[simplicity]], but different clarity
- #IMHO: [[simplicity]] is defined at the semantic level, and [[clarity]] at the syntactic level
