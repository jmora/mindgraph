- Cognitive load may be considered a synonym for [[complexity]], but it is less ambiguous ([[complexity]] may refer to computational [[complexity]])
- Similarly, it is the opposite of [[simplicity]]
- It is a [[burden]]. It is more significant when reading and understanding code. It limits the [[speed]] at which changes are possible, and therefore [[maintainability]], and moves the needle of the corresponding codebase from [[asset]] to [[liability]] ([[asset-liability duality]])
- An easy and measure cognitive load objectively is counting the aspects that need to be paid [[attention]] to and kept in mind to understand a piece of code, e.g. number of variables, points at which they change values, etc.

- [[functional programming]] [[principles]] may be applied in any language and they will usually decrease the [[cognitive load]] of the corresponding codebase
