- The ideal team size seems to be 5-9 persons, limited by the exponential number of communication channels (Brook's law)
- Communication is especially relevant towards decision makers (see [[decision making]])

	- In particular, the need for any [[negotiation]] is eliminated, [[decision making]] is greatly simplified, and any module to replace is easier to replace
- [[Insight]] is not easily transferable from one person to another
	- A background is necessary, ELI5 may only provide limited and shallow insight
	- The speed of communication is important, but it is always limited
