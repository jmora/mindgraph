alias:: miscommunication

- See: [[asynchronous work]], in particular: ((6255de47-f2a8-4717-a564-d0593da027a3)), [[common mistakes in communication]]
- The ideal team size seems to be 5-9 persons, limited by the exponential number of communication channels (Brook's law)
- Communication is especially relevant towards decision makers (see [[decision making]])

- Communication is particularly challenging between groups with different backgrounds or purposes

- Communication may be misleading and destroy value, as may be marketing that narrows decision options and leaves "out of the box" possibly better options than the ones remaining within the box

- #speculation a different local maximum is found in a team size of 1, i.e. achieve decoupling at the individual level, integrate in several layers, not at once

	- In particular, the need for any [[negotiation]] is eliminated, [[decision making]] is greatly simplified, and any module to replace is easier to replace
- [[Insight]] is not easily transferable from one person to another
	- A background is necessary, ELI5 may only provide limited and shallow insight
	- The speed of communication is important, but it is always limited

	- Capturing the [[insight]] with a [[knowledge graph]], which can then be sent in an email is just a dream

- Assumptions are liabilities. Related: [[speed]], [[burden]], [[friction]], [[liability]].
	- Source of infinite confusion: people try to fit their assumptions in a reality that is not able to accommodate them.
	  * Succinct [[communication]] does not provide enough information put in [[context]] with the assumptions, they will feel something is missing out, and you should explain it in more detail.
	  * More detailed [[communication]] provides a lot of information that still does not fit with the assumptions, they will feel that you are providing a level of detail that makes everything unnecessarily confusing.
	  * A minimal example is expecting a “yes / no” answer and getting instead an “it depends” answer.
	  * The only option is “debugging” the assumptions of the people you are talking with. This goes from “easy,” when they can put them into words and make them explicit, to “nearly impossible” when not only they cannot put them into words and but also they do not have the time or patience for what seems a “pointless conversation.”
	  * Independently from the difficulty (from easy to nearly impossible) the debugging certainly implies a cost. If the cost is sufficiently high, the return of the [[communication]] may be lower, with a negative net value.
	  * The alternative is remaining vague, to accommodate all kinds of assumptions and contradictions. But then [[communication]] is not happening.
