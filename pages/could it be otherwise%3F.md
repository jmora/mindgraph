- Some assertions may be surprising and yet they could not be otherwise. For example:
  * Cans were invented in 1810 and the can opener was invented in 1858, nearly 50 years later.
  * Could it be otherwise? Well, yes, they could have been invented simultaneously, and introduced to the market in the same way, similarly to PS3 and blu-ray.
  * Considering the constraints of the time, it makes sense, though; and the 48 year gap happened.
- There are better examples, everything is a [[draft]]. (I just donâ€™t tag this as one, because I do not want to revisit it.)
