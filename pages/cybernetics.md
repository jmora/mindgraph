- > “[[cybernetics]] is concerned with **circular causal processes** however they are embodied, including in ecological, technological, biological, cognitive and social [[systems]] and also in the [[context]] of practical activities such as designing, learning, managing, etc. Its transdisciplinary character has meant that [[cybernetics]] intersects with a number of other fields, leading to it having both wide influence and diverse interpretations.” — Wikipedia (emphasis mine)
- Consistent small errors in circular causal processes may compound into big errors.
- Some of these errors are [cognitive biases]([[bias]]), which may be considered as “bugs in human nature.”
	- Cognitive biases are relevant for AI, and its [[alignment]].
	  * If AI is intended to be human-like, it should be biased like humans.
	  * An unbiased AI may be less likeable than an AI that is biased in the usual human way.
	  * Do not confuse cognitive biases with bias in ML $$\approx$$ MSE, see also precision and accuracy.
