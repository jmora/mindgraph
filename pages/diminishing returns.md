- [[Diminishing returns]] usually hint at a high [[opportunity cost]] in additional investment or resource assignment ([[resource management]]), with the resources better invested or spent on something else.
- However, low quantities of resources assigned may result in [[diminishing returns]] early, due to a limitation in the logistic channel (see [[logistic curve]]). The right choice in that case is working on increasing the channel.
- Summarizing:
  * Problem: early onset of [[diminishing returns]].
  * Action: work to increase the logistic channel.
