- The duct tape effect may be translated as: “a true Scotsman can solve everything with a hammer” it is a combination of:
	- [[golden hammer]]: duct tape fixes everything
	- [no true Scotsman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman) fallacy: if you are not fixing it with duct tape, it is not ~~true~~ enough duct tape
- Related: [[first idea effect]] (duct tape is the first and last idea)
