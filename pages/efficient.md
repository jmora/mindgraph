		- Doing the right thing >> doing the thing fast
			- Digging deeper faster is not the solution at the lack of [[situational awareness]]

			- Before committing at hard "work", [[validate first]] that the work is "smart"
				- Otherwise, you may be working hard and efficiently at digging your own grave
