- > Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. [[Agile]] processes harness change for the customerâ€™s competitive advantage.
- You should [[embrace change]] especially in the [[problem formulation]] stage. An easy way to do that with code is:
  * Take a [[function-first]] approach
  * Each function receives and returns a dictionary
  * When values are missing in the received dictionary, defaults are used instead
