- The core problem of embracing ignorance is how often the embraced ignorance is only the tip of the iceberg, with a greater meta-ignorance, including a lack of [[situational awareness]].

	- Summary:
	  * Ignorance is unavoidable.
	  * There are “dragons” in ignorance (unbounded risk).
	  * Flight or fight, do not embrace.
- Ignorance should not be embraced, but carefully managed.
	- First, we should be aware of it, as part of the [[situational awareness]].
	- Second, acquiring the corresponding knowledge should be the default option, and only discarded when the return (ROI, ROTI) is negative, or there are better options in terms of [[opportunity cost]], e.g. we reached [[diminishing returns]] on knowledge acquisition.
- For example: Accepting [[unknown variables]] (and possibly [[compartmentalization]] with them) should be a last resource.
	- Intuitively, both science and philosophy try to build knowledge, embracing ignorance is against both of them.
	- Stochastic approaches are [[effective]], and allow managing ignorance economically.
	  * Information rarely is perfect, usually is partial, and improving it is costly.
	  * Statistics help to make better decisions with partial and approximate information, e.g. [[predictive models]] allow for predicting unknown values.
	  * Sometimes, acquiring additional information 
	  * While the cost of accepting ignorance is usually clear, and [[risk]]-free, the cost and potential ROI of acquiring better information is often less clear, implying a greater [[risk]].
	  * As a result, there is a bias towards accepting low information [[quality]], and just dealing with it, i.e. embracing ignorance.
	- Classical diagnosis [[expert systems]] manage ignorance by considering the cost of [[tests]].
	- Knowledge should not be pursued at any cost, but ignorance should not be accepted at any cost either.
	- Embracing ignorance refers to accepting ignorance and rejecting the pursue of knowledge when the [[ROI]] would in fact be positive, and the best option. It is a costly mistake, especially when considering [[opportunity cost]].
