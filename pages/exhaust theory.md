- When trying to do something, if there is prior art and theory on it, you are normally better off exhausting it before taking an [[empirical]] or trial-and-error approach.
	- Making errors and discarding options in your mind or on paper is usually cheaper than making errors in the architecture of a system
	- Especially if these errors will not be noted before months of iterations and running into an unforeseen case
- Similarly, when solving a problem, the corresponding [[definition]] and characterization of the problem allow understanding the problem and finding a solution to it, faster, and with better foundations.
	- Good foundations allow for [[incremental]] work, rather than [[disposable]] work that goes back to square one iteratively. ([[Sisyphos curse]])
- #speculation there is a bias against theory for a number of reasons, including the use of fake theory by impostors.
	- Related: impostors, market for lemons, Emperor's new clothes.
	- There is a maximum asymmetry that a market may sustain before degenerating into a market for lemons.

		- Analogous asymmetries are:
		  * Generator - discriminator in GANs. Discriminators are normally simpler than generators, but they may be too [[simple]] on occasions.
		  * NP-complete problems have a NP [[complexity]] to solve them, but the [[complexity]] of validating the answer is P. (assuming NP $$\neq$$ P)
		  * Measuring a program in bytes is trivial, comparing programs is trivial (_judging_ a program length). The Kolmogorov [[complexity]] (_producing_ the shortest program) is undecidable.
	- Disregarding theory results in further ignorance about it, creating a feedback loop that results in a complete absence of theory, or [[underthinking]].
