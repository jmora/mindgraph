- Disclaimer: do not [[exhaust theory]], it may be infinite. Instead start with it and consider when to move to more costly approaches when reaching [[diminishing returns]]. However, “start with theory, move to trial-and-error when reaching [[diminishing returns]], and consider returning to theory if you find out additional information that makes it a good investment again” might be a too long title.
- When trying to do something, if there is prior art and theory on it, you are normally better off starting with that before taking an [[empirical]] or trial-and-error approach.
	- Making errors and discarding options in your mind or on paper is usually cheaper than making errors in the architecture of a system
	- Especially if these errors will not be noted before months of iterations and running into an unforeseen case
- Similarly, when solving a problem, the corresponding [[definition]] and characterization of the problem allow understanding the problem and finding a solution to it, faster, and with better foundations.
	- Good foundations allow for [[incremental]] work, rather than [[disposable]] work that goes back to square one iteratively. ([[Sisyphos curse]])
	- Normally, nothing is more costly than doing work that is ultimately useless and discarded. Related [[Lean]].
- #speculation there is a bias against theory for a number of reasons, including the use of fake theory by impostors.
	- Related: [[impostor]], [[market for lemons]], [[illusion]].
	- There is a maximum asymmetry that a market may sustain before degenerating into a [[market for lemons]].

		- Analogous asymmetries are:
		  * Generator - discriminator in GANs. Discriminators are normally simpler than generators, but they may be too [[simple]] on occasions.
		  * NP-complete problems have a NP [[complexity]] to solve them, but the [[complexity]] of validating the answer is P. (assuming NP $$\neq$$ P)
		  * Measuring a program in bytes is trivial, comparing programs is trivial (_judging_ a program length). The Kolmogorov [[complexity]] (_producing_ the shortest program) is undecidable.
	- Disregarding theory results in further ignorance about it, creating a feedback loop that results in a complete absence of theory, or [[underthinking]].
