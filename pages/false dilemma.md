alias:: multiplicative system

- Inspired by: [Multiplicative Systems: Understanding The Power of Multiplying by Zero](https://fs.blog/multiplicative-systems/)
- Mathematical generalization: [t-norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-norm)
- [[Situation]]: [[quality]] depends on two or more variables
  * Possibly but not necessarily asymmetrically, as in an [[asymmetric two-sided problem]]
  * The dilemma is presented as having to choose between both
- Solution:
  * Choose both
  * Balance them
  * Try to improve the aggregated (improve one variable without harming other variable)
- Examples:
  * F1 score: precision vs recall
  * Model: data vs algorithms
  * Anything, e.g. data: [[quality]] vs quantity
  * Train models: Training cycles vs model size
  * [[strategy]]: results of execution (ambition) vs ease of execution (certainty)
  * Bottom-line, pricing: number of customers vs customer lifetime value. Related: [[Laffer curve]], [[Jevons paradox]]
