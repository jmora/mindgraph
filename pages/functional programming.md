alias:: FP

- [[functional programming]] allows reducing the [[cognitive load]] of developers in several ways:
  * Immutable variables are assigned once, working as constants, which are much easier to account for  
  * Limited scope of variables (local function variables vs object attributes and global variables)
  * In general, by having less movable (or mutable) parts, and less code to consider, developers may focus on simpler and smaller fragments of code

- Less [[cognitive load]] (i.e. more [[simplicity]]) results in:
  * less surface or possibilities for bugs
  * better [[readability]] and [[maintainability]], with more [[speed]]
