	- Several tools exist, all of them have pros and cons, one is more applicable to all kinds of situations — a hammer. For example, an object may be used as a function, with state, that does not need to be used, so functions may be replaced with objects. Objects are not so easily replaced with functions.

	- In some cases the hammer is an overkill, but it still works, e.g. a class with only one static method used as a function. It could be a function, but the class still works.
	- Over time, the less applicable solutions occasionally need to be replaced with the more applicable solutions. The more applicable solutions become the go-to solutions — they just work.
	- People stop using the less applicable solutions. ~~Sticks~~ hammers become “[[standard procedure]].”
	- Eventually someone writes a book “Hammers solve everything,” “a hammer is all you need,” or “how to solve everything with a hammer.” Hammers are the “best practice.”
- The main reason Python is gradually becoming more like Java is more related with [[town planners]]’ preferences than applicability of [[OOP]] (Python being multi-paradigm…) but [[OOP]] being a [[golden hammer]] (million dollar mistake included) probably plays a part in it.
