alias:: GOFAI, symbolic artificial [[intelligence]], symbolic AI

- [[GOFAI]] is considered a subset of symbolic AI, with symbolic AI allowing for probabilistic reasoning, fuzzy logic, and the representation of uncertainty and ambiguity in a handful of ways.
- However, I use both terms as synonyms. Not as a criticism of symbolic AI, but as praise of [[GOFAI]].
  * [[GOFAI]] giving a greater weight to [[formal research]].
  * Deep learning giving a greater weight to [[empirical research]].
  In my [[opinion]]: both need to be combined, properly.

- Note: [[machine learning]] (without [[deep learning]]) is technically [[symbolic AI]]. However, in practice, it is closer to deep learning in its methods, e.g. [[iterative method]]:
  * Iterative methods ($$\approx$$trial and error), are usual in [[machine learning]].
  * Direct methods, [[theoretical]] approaches, and whiteboard discussions are less usual. This may result from a [[bitter lesson]], e.g. ((6422e774-40b8-4707-b288-4e1a03088680)), or ((6422e774-1e0a-4728-8c49-4ddd586d123b))
  > Note: Iterative methods without proper foundations may result in being [[fooled by data]].
