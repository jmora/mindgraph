alias:: GOFAI, symbolic artificial [[intelligence]], symbolic AI

- [[GOFAI]] is considered a subset of symbolic AI, with symbolic AI allowing for probabilistic reasoning, fuzzy logic, and the representation of uncertainty and ambiguity in a handful of ways.
- However, I use both terms as synonyms. Not as a criticism of symbolic AI, but as praise of [[GOFAI]].
  * [[GOFAI]] giving a greater weight to [[formal research]].
  * Deep learning giving a greater weight to [[empirical research]].
  In my [[opinion]]: both need to be combined, properly.

- Note: [[machine learning]] (without deep learning) is technically symbolic AI. However, in practice, it is closer to deep learning in that iterative methods, or trial and error, are more often applied than [[theoretical]] approaches or thinking on a whiteboard. This is a mistake, and normally results in being [[fooled by data]].
