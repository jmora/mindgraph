- [[Risk]] at embracing [[information asymmetry]] and subjectivity (mentioned here as "need to sell"): [[market for lemons]]

- For example:
  * A client wants a solution for a information integration.
  * Alice is a consultant and presents a catalogue with 20 options, to discuss with the client what works best for them, after a better understanding of 
  * Bob is a consultant and uses the [[Barnum effect]] to describe the [[situation]] of the client, and then the one solution he sells ([[law of the instrument]]).
	- In this [[context]]:
	  * A client that embraces [[information asymmetry]] will be appalled and overwhelmed by the level of detail of Alice, thinking something along the lines: “I pay you to worry about these details, so that I do not have to.”
	  * This client may be impressed by Bob’s depth of knowledge (by the Barnum effect), and choose Bob for both reasons.
	  * However, the client would have been better off taking the time to gain [[situational awareness]] with Alice, and implement the solution that is best suited to their [[goal]], [[context]], and capabilities.
		- On a side note:
		  * Someone trying to rationalize their choices and biases may reply to the previous: “you do not know, perhaps Bob is offering exactly what they need.” (I have seen this too many times with similar examples.) However, this is a [[theoretical]] example, a thought experiment, which I am defining and describing. Therefore, in this example everything is exactly the way I describe.
		  * What someone might say is: “you are describing a [[theoretical]] [[situation]] that never happens in practice, it is complete fantasy.” (I have never encountered this kind of criticism, but [[IMHO]] it is the only legit criticism, see [difference between maths and physics by Feynman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-eh2SD54fM)) To which, fair enough, the paradigmatic Alice, Bob, and client do not exist, but the example may still be applicable to real situations depending on how close the real actors are to the paradigmatic [[theoretical]] actors.
- Embracing [[information asymmetry]] is a type of [[consumer irresponsibility]].
