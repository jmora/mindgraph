	  > “I divide my officers into four groups. There are clever, diligent, stupid, and [[lazy]] officers. Usually two characteristics are combined. Some are clever and diligent — their place is the General Staff. The next lot are stupid and [[lazy]] — they make up 90 percent of every army and are suited to routine duties. Anyone who is both clever and [[lazy]] is qualified for the highest leadership duties, because he possesses the intellectual [[clarity]] and the composure necessary for difficult decisions. One must beware of anyone who is stupid and diligent — he must not be entrusted with any responsibility because he will always cause only mischief.” — Attributed to Erich von Manstein and Kurt Gebhard Adolf Philipp Freiherr von Hammerstein-Equord #quote
