alias:: sigmoid, [[logistic function]]

- See Wikipedia for [logistic function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function), it is good enough.
- Reminder: search the web (especially Wikipedia) or ask GPT for the pages that I link but have no content, normally they are good enough.
  collapsed:: true
	- In fact the pages that have content assume that you would already know or search for the usual information or general knowledge available on the Internet.
	- In theory, it is obvious that when something is already done and good enough, there is no point in doing the same thing with a lower [[quality]].
	- In practice, it is very common, as part of a [[strategy]] of competing in price.
	- This makes sense with rival goods.
	- It does not make sense with anti-rival goods, like knowledge.
	- But still it is done (profitably) by marketing the lower [[quality]] content more aggressively, or effectively. That's a [[bitter lesson]].
- “Why do you link them in that case?” — you may ask…
- For the backlinks, i.e. the linked references that you may see at the end of each page.
