- Marginal refers to the change in quantity when producing one additional unit.
  collapsed:: true
	- From ChatGPT: marginal utility, marginal value, marginal benefit, and marginal cost, they all refer to the change in a quantity when consuming or producing one additional unit. Here’s how they differ:
	  * Marginal Utility – The extra satisfaction or [[usefulness]] gained from consuming one more unit of a good. It usually declines as consumption increases (diminishing marginal utility).
	  * Marginal Value – The extra worth or [[importance]] assigned to one more unit of a good or service. In a market, marginal value = marginal utility in monetary terms—i.e., how much someone is willing to pay for one more unit.
	  * Marginal Benefit – The additional gain or advantage from consuming or producing one more unit. This is broader than utility and could include financial, social, or strategic benefits.
	  * Marginal Cost – The extra expense incurred to produce or acquire one more unit of a good or service. This includes material, labor, and opportunity costs.
	  
	  **Key Relationships:**
	  * [[Efficient]] production/consumption happens when marginal benefit = marginal cost.
	  * Price in competitive markets tends to equal marginal cost.
	  * Marginal value and marginal benefit are closely related but not always identical — marginal benefit includes all advantages, not just monetary ones.
- It it quantitative in nature, but we may make similar considerations with [[quality]], by quantizing [[quality]].
- In the [[context]] of the [[Pareto principle]], 80% of the value is created with 20% of the work.
- However, in a winner-takes-all [[context]], it is the last 1% of the value created and the work done what makes the difference, i.e. 20% of the work may create the initial 80% of the value, but it is the last 1% of the value that is responsible for 90% of the revenue.
