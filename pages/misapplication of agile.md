- Agile allows progress without initial insight, acquiring the insight along the way
	- Good: Write working code, avoid [[Byzantine discussion]]
	- The lack of insight does not prevent the application of agile
	- The [[insight]] is not guaranteed at the end of the [[process]], it may be a “useful [[illusion]]”
		- All models are wrong, some are useful
		- But they may not be useful forever ([[inductivist turkey]])
	- The tyranny of agile: If insight is available, it may be ignored, and then agile applied

- Risks, threats: [[Parkinson's law of triviality]], shallow exploration, [[adding epicycles]], [[cargo cult]] (excessive [[attention]] to interfaces), [[underthinking]], [[wicked problem]]s, [[locality risk]]
- The [[misapplication of Agile]] may jeopardize: [[Insight]], deep thinking, [[simplicity]] (by [[accretion]] in each sprint resulting in [[complexity]])
	- ((629ccaf6-5185-4134-ba37-3251f6bb7a03))
	- The [[misapplication of Agile]] is against the [[Agile principles]], most notably:
		- [[simplicity]]: maximize the work not done and
		- [[continuous improvement]]: by considering each sprint as an isolated instance with nothing to extrapolate
		- waterfallification of [[Agile]]: never going backward (should [[embrace change]])
