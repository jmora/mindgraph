- In a [[multiplicative system]]: excessive focus one of the variables, usually in a self-reinforcing manner.
- Problem: the variable that should get more [[attention]] is the one that is getting less [[attention]], but efforts towards improving the result increase this imbalance

- The problem may arise from a lack of [[situational awareness]]:
	- Mechanism one:
	  * One variable was neglected
	  * More focus on that variable provided good results
	  * The other variables are neglected
	- Mechanism two:
	  * A competitor of organization $$\mathcal{O}$$ got good results by focusing on one variable $$\mathcal{v}$$
	  * Now $$\mathcal{O}$$ focuses on $$\mathcal{v}$$, even if other variable was more neglected and a better choice for $$\mathcal{O}$$
