- What is obvious to you may not be obvious to other people, related: [[Dunning-Kruger effect]]
- Asking for the obvious may help to identify assumptions, and eliminate wrong assumptions — err on the side of caution

- You may have a checklist to decide if something meets an obviousness threshold, e.g., [[decision trees]] seemed obvious to me, in hindsight, if they were so obvious no university lectures would be spent on explaining them
	- If something is explained in detail online, it might not be obvious, fortunately, linking to it is easy and quick.
	- If you have to ask an LLM to explain it to see if it can, it is not obvious.
		- Fortunately, if it can, you can just link to the explanation that you just produced to test that.
		- If an LLM cannot explain something, it is clearly not obvious.
		- If you do not agree with the way an LLM explains something, I have bad news for you (the news may only be that you need to explain it.)
	- Whatever floats your boat, [[obvs]].
