alias:: OOP

- [[OOP]] is a great programming paradigm, which resulted in it being the most popular programming paradigm (for now)
- As a result of its popularity, it is the most popular programming paradigm for programmers to shoot themselves on their feet, [[OOP]] provides several opportunities that developers use often and with great diligence. Popular ones include:
	- Using inheritance for code sharing (use aggregation or composition), inheritance breaks [[abstraction]]
	  * Note: inheritance is unnecessary for polymorphism with duck-typing
	- Focusing on the encapsulation by classes and objects (the lesser idea) and not on the messages (the bigger idea)
	- Not following the [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) [[principles]] in one way or another
