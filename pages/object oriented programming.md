alias:: OOP

- [[OOP]] is a great programming paradigm, which resulted in it being the most popular programming paradigm (for now)
- As a result of its popularity, it is the most popular programming paradigm for programmers to shoot themselves on their feet, [[OOP]] provides several opportunities that developers use often and with great diligence. Popular ones include:
	- Using inheritance for code sharing (use aggregation or composition), inheritance breaks [[abstraction]]
	  * Note: inheritance is unnecessary for polymorphism with duck-typing
	- Focusing on the encapsulation by classes and objects (the lesser idea) and not on the messages (the bigger idea)
	- Not following the [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) [[principles]] in one way or another
- > “I'm sorry that I long ago coined the term "objects" for this topic because it gets many people to focus on the lesser idea.” — [Alan Kay](http://wiki.c2.com/?AlanKayOnMessaging) #quote
- > “[[OOP]] to me means only messaging, local retention and protection and hiding of state-[[process]], and extreme late-binding of all things. It can be done in Smalltalk and in LISP.” — [Alan Kay](http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/~ram/pub/pub_jf47ht81Ht/doc_kay_oop_en) #quote
- When [[OOP]], consider: #.v-numlist
	- A [[function-first]] approach
	- [defensive practices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyABTfR9UTU) like pure functions
	- Or in general just do [[FP]] and introduce [[OOP]] only when necessary (if ever) :P
- > “I think the lack of reusability comes in object-oriented languages, not functional languages. Because the problem with object-oriented languages is they’ve got all this implicit environment that they carry around with them. You wanted a banana but what you got was a gorilla holding the banana and the entire jungle.

  > If you have referentially transparent code, if you have pure functions — all the data comes in its input arguments and everything goes out and leave no state behind — it’s incredibly reusable.”
