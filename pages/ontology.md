- **Disclaimer:**
	- This is an opinionated and simplified page
	- This is a draft and much would have to be corrected
		- e.g. before sharing as a blog or in any other way, if I ever do
	- Just like every other page
- I refer to the information science concept of ontology:
	- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)
- An ontology may often be confused with a [[knowledge graph]]
	- A knowledge graph is an ontology, whose predicates are binary
	- Ontologies may similarly be represented with Datalog and Prolog (n-ary predicates)
	- The most popular ontology languages use knowledge graph representations, though, e.g. OWL
- A knowledge graph has:
	- ABox: facts, i.e. information
	- TBox: knowledge: rules to derive new facts from other facts
- See also
	- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)#See_also
- Ontologies are useful to gain consensus, clarity, and shared insight, similarly to a [[Wardley map]]
	- The advantage of ontologies is that the knowledge in them may be used by [AI] algorithms
	- Much like ML models, it is useful for [[decision making]], and useless when ignored
	- Much like a book, it does not provide insight without looking into it, see [[communication]]
