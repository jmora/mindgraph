- [[Opportunity cost]] example:
	- You have a long time in a flight connection, you may go see the city and eat something.
	- You find a restaurant, it seems good wrt price, food [[quality]], distance,â€¦ the [[ROI]] seems good.
	- What is the [[opportunity cost]]? You do not know, you would need to compare with the best restaurant, or the second best. In fact, you would need to factor in all the things you would be missing out as a result of the cost, e.g.
	  * what you would do with the price difference
	  * what you would do with the time difference
	  * the [[risk]] of missing the flight if the distance is further, depending on the time it requires to get there
	  * different restaurants are in different locations, you may see different parts of the city (or consider distance not just to the airport but total travel distance), not all of them being equally interesting to you
- Often, we find that estimating the [[opportunity cost]] in detail is too difficult
  * We need complete information, which we usually do not have, requiring to factor in the cost of acquiring [[sufficient information]]
  * With complete information it would be NP-complete
  * Many problems are multi-[[objective]] problems, finding a [[reward function]] to project them into a single dimension is rarely trivial, even in a professional or corporate [[context]] (with future net profit as the [[reward function]])
	- It is worth considering at least two options, for contextualization
