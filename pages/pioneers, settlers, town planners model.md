- Main stages from problem solving
	- [[problem formulation]]
		- Find out what to do, what is the right thing
		- It may require
			- [[embrace change]] of [[direction]], run many experiments
			- [[subtraction]] of the obviously wrong approaches
			- prioritisation of approaches, AKA [[strategy]]
			- [[extrapolation]] for the previous (use your background in uncharted territory)
			  collapsed:: true
				- Otherwise, the approach would be like 5 year old toddlers finding every [[situation]] for the first time
				  * unprofessional [[brute force]] at best
				  * [[first idea effect]] most often
			- [[PoT]]
			  * the right thing is a possible thing
			  * checking that the idea is possible may be the main experiment, especially in the [[context]] of [[technical risk]]
			  * it may require problem reformulation, to make it possible (i.e. back to square zero)
		- It means
			- Doing the wrong thing most of the time
	- solution building  #TODO
		- Find out how to build it
		- It may require
			- setting the [[direction]], changing directions is wasteful
			- [[constant improvement]]
			-
		- It means
			- Doing the right thing, poorly at first, and competitively at the end, hence [[continuous improvement]]
			-
	- solution optimisation #TODO
		- Fine tuning
		- In most cases, if there is an option available in the market with this maturity, you do not want to make your own toaster
		-
		-
- The lifecycle of a solution will cover all stages, methodologies may focus on several stages (e.g. CRISP-ML on the first two stages)
	- After each stage, [[postmortem]] should help with [[constant improvement]]. Note that:
	  * the constant improvement of the solution applies mainly to [[settlers]], but
	  * the constant improvement of the team and their efforts ([[process optimization]]) applies to everyone
