tags:: [[bad practice]]

- [[principal-agent management]] is the [[principal-agent problem]] in a manager-maker setting. It is like this:
  
  * The manager makes decisions — judged by [[outcome]].
  * The workers make everything else — judged by [[output]]. In this [[context]], they have no [[autonomy]].
  * If the [[outcome]] is as expected, the manager succeeded, having decided correctly the [[output]] that would produce the desired [[outcome]].
  * If the [[outcome]] is not as expected, the makers failed.
      * They produced an [[output]] that is not good enough to produce the desired [[outcome]], and
      * They are too slow to iterate enough to reach the correct [[output]] (identifiable by its [[outcome]]).
- There are two main ways to avoid this bad practice:
	- Division of labor: the decision makers need to define the [[output]] properly, and not iteratively in a [[wild goose chase]]. Only then the workers may hit their target, or fail at it.
	- Flat organizations: if the workers have autonomy to make the decisions, there is no manager-maker division, and they may be judged by [[outcome]]. In a way, they are their own managers. While this sounds good in theory (#[[personal opinion]]: it _is_ good) it is also very difficult to achieve in practice, especially in large organizations
