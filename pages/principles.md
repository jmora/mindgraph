- Consider chess and candidate selection:
  * The [[principles]] of [[strategy]] should be the same for regular chess or chess after changing some of its rules — it is a different [[strategy]] game, but it is equally strategic
  * It is well known that when changing the rules of chess, grandmasters do not have an advantage over regular folks (I can try to search for a reference if you cannot find it and absolutely need it)
  * Consequently, chess does not seem to be a [[strategy]] game as much as a pattern recognition game, see also [[System 1 and System 2]]
  * Therefore, chess players normally use the ultimate [[principles]] or rules of chess, and not the [[first principles]] of [[strategy]]
  * The rules change, they underperform
  * To some extent, in AI, software, and business, the rules change quite often, especially the ultimate rules (e.g. data availability, cost of computation, scalability, etc.) Some rule changers are cloud, GPUs, big data, smartphones, [[remote work]],…
  * [[Food for thought]]: are your interviews asking about the most durable [[first principles]] or the latest rules with the shortest self-life? See also [[Lindy effect]]
