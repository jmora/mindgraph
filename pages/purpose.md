alias:: objective, goal

- Related: [[cybernetics]] studies _purposive systems_
- A purpose allows for "starting with why", i.e. a top-down approach, based on first principles
	- Without a purpose, the usual approach is by analogy, bottom-up, the result may be [[Cargo cult]], especially when combined with [[Naive realism]]
- Consider the distance of the _de facto_ definition in a [[process]] with the _nominal_ purpose
	- The nominal purpose may include elements not in the de facto definition, or not aligned with it. These elements will either not happen, or add friction
		- e.g. bimodal or two-tiered R&D may provide two orthogonal purposes for research

			- Research has two purposes in this model:
				- Solutions to engineers: measured as solutions delivered to production
				- Competitive state of the art: measured as patents and publications
			- This model falls short compared to the [[PST model]]
			- The gap in between both purposes is often not measured, and therefore not managed. If the gap is too large (missing [[settlers]]), the two purposes of [[research]] may be impossible to reconcile. The potential [[outcomes]] are not good:
			  * Fail at one
			  * Fail at both
			  * [[Illusion]] of success on top of one or both previous failures
			- Of course they may happen to be successfully reconciled. You may find more information elsewhere on the Internet, e.g. Simon DeDeo wrote a Twitter thread some time ago.

- An objective is part of a [[strategy]], it must not be confused with the strategy
	- Example of confusion (note: a [[plan]] should not be confused with a strategy either)

- Related: [[mathematical optimization]] uses an [[objective function]]
- In general, a goal is equivalent to a [[purpose]], or an [[objective]]. The main difference is that a purpose and an objective may be dynamic, while a goal is assumed to be static, i.e. not [[moving the goalposts]]
