- [[Quality]] may be defined as: "fitness for a [[purpose]]"
	- Normally it is the result of a [[process]], i.e. not a coincidence
	- Quality may be what separates assets from liabilities: [[asset-liability duality]]
- Better code is cheaper code
	- [[Boots theory]]
	- [Is high quality software worth the cost?](https://martinfowler.com/articles/is-quality-worth-cost.html) — Martin Fowler
- The same principles applicable to code apply beyond code
	- Beware of hidden costs, e.g. [[opportunity cost]]
	- Consider principles and methods

- Interesting to consider [[quality]] in the [[context]] of the [[innovator's dilemma]]
	- [[incremental innovation]] (or quantitative innovation) may not result in the same [[quality]] improvement as initial innovation (or [[qualitative]] innovation)
	- [[incremental innovation]] may in fact result in a loss of [[quality]]
		- Example: [You'll never be happy with the Steam Deck 2](https://viewsink.com/youll-never-be-happy-with-the-steam-deck-2) criticizes «the “[[bigger number better]]” mentality», among other examples in the article:
		  * More resolution (as a main [[KPI]]) results in negative consequences for other [[KPIs]], like battery duration.
		  * More resolution, given the size of the screen, would not improve the [[UX]].
		  Beware of this kind of “[[golden KPI]].”
