	- I like quotes: they encapsulate in a few words ideas that may be [[complex]] and insightful. Due to compression of the ideas in a few words, they may be misunderstood. Everything has a cost, concision is no exception. Still worth it, [[IMHO]]. In fact, it might be a feature: misunderstood quotes may result in better meanings than the original [[purpose]].
	- I try to give credit where credit is due, but this is not always easy. I care about the ideas in the quotes more than the authors. When in doubt, [QuoteInvestigator](https://quoteinvestigator.com/) has proven to be a good and reliable source.
