- [[readability]] is the inverse property of the [[cognitive load]] resulting from reading a piece of code
	- it results from the [[simplicity]] (avoidance of unnecessary [[complexity]]) of the code
	- it is not a result of the spacing, tabs vs spaces, length of the lines,... (use a code formatter for that)
	- it is not a result of the comments, in fact code [[readability]] is inversely proportional to the _necessary_ comments
		-
- [[readability]] depends on the familiarity of the reader with the structure of the code: a more complex but more familiar structure will seem more readable than a more simple but less familiar structure. See also [[Clojure]]
	- This is particularly obvious when new syntax forms are introduced in a language or the reader is used to other languages, e.g. list comprehensions in Python compared to Java for loops
	- Similarly, it may impact negatively evolution in terms of paradigms, e.g. [[OOP]] vs [[FP]]
	- When [[readability]] is not considered objectively, it is misleading as a [[metric]], and biased against new (and possibly better) ways to write the code
- When [[readability]] is considered with objectivity, it is the most relevant aspect for code [[quality]]
