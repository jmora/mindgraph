- Relative is often confused with subjective, in contraposition to evaluating something objectively.
	- The confusion might be related to the theory of relativity, where previously considered absolute quantities are in fact relative to the _observer_.
	- However, a measurement may (arguably, should) be _relative_ to the _object_ and not the _subject_ of that evaluation.
	- Consider the [[context]] of decision-making in most organizations, data-driven approaches,...
- The opposite of relative is absolute, which may result in dogma.

- In the [[context]] of a program:
  * A function output is relative to its input. (Computers are considered to behave objectively, not subjectively.)
  * A constant is absolute.
  * A variable is dependent on the [[context]] (e.g. moment of observation), i.e. relative to it.
- When possible, prefer the use of proportional (or proportionate), or corresponding, to relative, as it is less confusing. It is not always possible.
