alias:: consumer responsibility, irresponsible consumption, consumer irresponsibility

- e.g. according to the [[buying hierarchy]] reliability should be a priority. When consumers are not responsible, price is more salient and may be prioritized.
- Personal anecdote:
  * Bought a cheap led light to use with the webcam. “If it breaks, it breaks.”
  * After months of use, its battery exploded, spilling liquid over the computer.
  * I cleaned the liquid with no noticeable further consequences, but it could have ended very differently.
  * The cost of a €10 light could have been orders of magnitude higher.
