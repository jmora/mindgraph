- If innovation is about "living in the future", failing at it means living in a future that does not materialize, i.e. a parallel reality. This is a prevalent problem, resulting from a lack of situational awareness ([[reality check]])
	- #conjecture as companies are larger and more hierarchical, they experience a problem similar to the vanishing gradient. Without active efforts to counter this phenomenon, inner layers get further from the reality, and lose sight of it, resulting in a [[delusion]], or parallel reality
		- There are many approaches to address this problem, e.g. see [[decision making]], with varying degrees of [[effectiveness]] depending on the [[context]]
- All models are wrong, some are useful. Hammers are useful, but do not fall in love with them

		- Explain:
		  * "All models are wrong, some are useful"
		  * The "Law of the instrument" or what is a "golden hammer"
		  * Why in the context of the previous we may say that "Hammers are useful, but do not fall in love with them"
		- Answer:
		  * "All models are wrong, some are useful" is a well-known quote often attributed to the statistician George Box. It is often used to emphasize the idea that all models, including "golden hammers," are simplifications of reality that are inherently limited in their ability to accurately represent the world. As such, it is important to use models judiciously and to not become too reliant on any one model, no matter how useful it may seem.
		  * The "Law of the instrument" is a cognitive bias that describes the tendency for people to over-rely on a familiar tool or approach, even when it may not be the best option for a particular situation. This bias is often referred to as the "golden hammer" because it is like using a hammer to solve every problem, regardless of whether a hammer is the best tool for the job.
		  * In the context of the previous quote, "Hammers are useful, but do not fall in love with them" suggests that it is important to use models and tools judiciously, and to be open to alternative approaches. The reference to hammers is likely used as a metaphor for a tool or approach that is effective in certain situations, but may not be appropriate in all circumstances. The phrase "do not fall in love with them" is a warning against becoming overly attached to a particular model or tool, and suggests that it is important to consider the limitations of any model and to be open to alternative approaches.
- The problem with many mental models and principles is that they may be situational dependent, and misleading if not applied in the corresponding situation
	- See also [[quantification]]: Situational awareness may provide a similar result: what is true in one situation is not true in a different one. Two opposite things may both be true, in their corresponding contexts, or to different extents
	- i.e. they may be true, but not the whole truth

- #conjecture situational awareness, especially [[future awareness]] is related with empathy with future-self (see also [[common sense]])
