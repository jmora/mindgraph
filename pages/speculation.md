alias:: conjecture

- tag for speculative thoughts, related: [[IMHO]], [[personal principle]], [[could it be otherwise?]]
- I like [[conjecture]] more:
  * [[conjecture]] seems to refer to the result of the activity (speculating)
  * [[speculation]] seems to refer to the activity itself (speculating)
  
  But “[[conjecture]]” sounds unnecessarily “pedantic,” so [[whatever]]...
- Sometimes my “conjectures” may:
  * have been proven scientifically, out of my field of expertise. Sorry for that, life is too short.
  * be obvious — no point in proving the obvious.
  * be wrong — let me know in that case so that I can be *less wrong*.
- I try to make them a fairly obvious consequence of well known facts, or a “very educated” guess, i.e. a [[could it be otherwise?]] kind of [[situation]].
- If you have data and science, go with that. If all you have is partial information, educated guesses, and reasonable theories, that might be better than ignorance, randomness, and wishful thinking.
