alias:: conjecture

- tag for speculative thoughts
- I like [[conjecture]] more:
  * [[conjecture]] seems to refer to the result of the activity (speculating)
  * speculation seems to refer to the activity itself (speculating)
  
  But "[[conjecture]]" sounds unnecessarily "pedantic," so [[whatever]]...
