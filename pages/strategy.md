- A [[strategy]] has: [[context]], [[plan]], and [[objective]]
- For a generally applicable [[strategy]] ([[context]] independent), consider instead [[doctrine]]
-
- Some people consider [[strategy]] requires selectivity ([[subtraction]]: [Alignment & Coherence: The old and the new](https://strategyinpraxis.substack.com/p/alignment-and-coherence)  — [JP Castlin](https://substack.com/@strategyinpraxis))
  * i.e. saying “no” to things that may make sense, may be good, and may better for someone else
  * AKA: focus, concentrate efforts, do not spread yourself too thin, e.g. in the [[context]] of [[opportunity cost]] 
  * Especially assuming a [[logistic function]], you may want to be sure to pass its “exponential part”, even reach [[diminishing returns]], before starting an unrelated one
  * When focusing, consider if you are in an [[asymmetric two-sided problem]] or a [[false dilemma]]
  * Arguably, a [[strategy]] that rejects the obviously wrong is just [[common sense]], and one that does not is [[brute force]]
