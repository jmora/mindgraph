	- > The streetlight effect, or the drunkard's search principle, is a type of observational bias that occurs when people only search for something where it is easiest to look. Both names refer to a well-known joke:
	  > > A policeman sees a drunk man searching for something under a streetlight and asks what the drunk has lost. He says he lost his keys and they both look under the streetlight together. After a few minutes the policeman asks if he is sure he lost them here, and the drunk replies, no, and that he lost them in the park. The policeman asks why he is searching here, and the drunk replies, "this is where the light is".[2]

- The streetlight effect may lead to numerology from data scientists when the necessary data is not available and asking for it is either:
  * not acceptable, e.g. command-and-control organizations
  * not feasible, e.g. too much bureaucracy or friction introducing delays incompatible with the project schedule
  * not effective, e.g. the corresponding data is not collected and cannot be done by ineffectiveness in other parts of the organization, result: kakonomy
- The solutions may come from several different areas:
	- [[process]]: Searching in the right place should be made easier, or searching in the wrong place should be made more difficult
	- [[validate first]]: prioritize finding out where to search before investing a significant [[sunk cost]] searching in the wrong places
