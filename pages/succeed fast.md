- Try to get something to work, end-to-end, even if not in the ideal way (expensive, not optimal,…)
- Consider two flights, from London to Sydney:
  * Flight A: takes 100h total, stops in Singapore for 2+ days, extremely uncomfortable and expensive seat, reliable, 100% guaranteed gets you there.
  * Flight B: direct flight, 5 hours total, comfortable seat, cheap, gets you there 99% of the distance, then runs out of fuel, crashes, and everyone dies.
