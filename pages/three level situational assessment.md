alias:: SNAFU, TARFU, TARFUN, FUBAR

- Taken from [military slang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_military_slang_terms)
- The three levels themselves #.v-numlist
	- [[SNAFU]]: “[[Situation]] normal, all fucked up.” Business as usual. The [[situation]] is never ideal, we may need to cut some corners, or _all_ corners, we would like to:
	  * have more time, resources,
	  * write better code,
	  * eliminate [[technical debt]] rather than accumulate it,
	  * etc.
	  But time is always limited, we do as much as we can with the time we are given.
	- [[TARFUN]]: “Things are really fucked up now.” By contraposition, this is not normal, and remedy actions are needed to return to a normal [[situation]]. This is not business as usual, and something must be done about it. We may need a new [[plan]], but the [objectives]([[objective]]) are not out of reach yet.
	- [[FUBAR]]: “Fucked up beyond all repair.” Things were really fucked up before, but remedy actions were not taken or they were not completely [[effective]]. Return to business as usual according to the [[plan]] is not possible, and a new [[plan]] for new [objectives]([[objective]]) is needed. When repairing is not possible, we replace.
- This is in contrast with the [four level strategy from Yes, Minister](https://youtu.be/3hua1pkDmJc), a fictional [[standard procedure]] from the foreign office for a response in a time of crisis: #.v-numlist
	- “Nothing is going to happen.”
	- “Something may be going to happen, but we should do nothing about it.”
	- “Maybe we should do something about it, but there is nothing that we can do.”
	- “Maybe there was something that we could have done, but it is too late now.”
- In this framework #.v-numlist
	- [[SNAFU]]: something is happening, something is happening _all the time_. That is the normal [[situation]], and our job is doing something about it, or making it happen.
	- [[TARFUN]]: there are several things we can do. Among all the things we can do, we have to do something else, because the current option will not yield the expected results.
	- [[FUBAR]]: we failed (not by inaction), now we learn if there was something that we could have done better, to make new and exciting mistakes next time, and we move on to a new and different [[SNAFU]].
