- Needs a better title
- Interesting [[context]]: [[Research]] $$\approx$$ systematic effort (repeatable) for the discovery of _new_ knowledge (new, not repeated)
- Relevant: [[situational awareness]], [[extrapolation]], generalize, [[first principles]]

- Repeatable success (3+ times) and cause-effect relationships that do not account for factors in the [[context]] that were constant previously (e.g. necessary but not sufficient causes, worse: neither necessary nor sufficient) will result in [[believability]] and trust, but it is just blind faith
	- Previous success is not as relevant as the cause-effect understanding

		- ((63bbc797-6260-4e01-a02c-3bf2016fbe7e))
	- Understanding the cause-effect relationships ([[first principles]], [[context]], [[situational awareness]],…), and being able to extrapolate and generalize to the new [[context]] is _everything_
		- But understanding cannot be judged as a black box, it needs to be understood as a white box
- [[GOFAI]] $$\approx$$ case-based reasoning
  collapsed:: true
  * [[Bitter lesson]]: more cases beats deeper reasoning
  * #speculation except for the very few things that are new
	- But for the things that are new:
	  * How good are people?
	  * How good are other people at judging the skills of other people?
