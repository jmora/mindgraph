- Sometimes spending weeks proving that something is undecidable saves years of a wild goose chase trying to solve an unsolvable problem, sometimes that does not help and a proxy or approximate solution is better, or avoiding the problem to begin with ([[subtraction]]). Sometimes some people may need to be reminded that their salary does not depend on solving problems but on getting results.

- This may not be entirely the case in academia, in academia people may in fact get extra points for doing something hard. Papers with good results but seemingly obvious may be rejected on that basis, while worse results with complex approaches may sell better; [[obvs.]]

- I do not think we need to explain that open chest surgery just for checking a heart condition is not an ideal approach when imaging methods like MRI scans are available, perhaps the challenge is finding the threshold where the easier approach is not ideal and the harder approach is preferred, even as an initial approach. In this case, [[decision trees]] help.
	- Consider two options: ultrasound vs MRI to check a heart condition, ultrasound costs $100 but it has only a 10% probability of being conclusive, MRI has a $1000 cost and a 100% probability of being conclusive. The options [[ceteris paribus]] are ultrasound yes or ultrasound no.

		- With those numbers, we are exactly at the break-even point, with a lower ratio `ultrasound_cost / MRI_cost` or a greater likelihood of a conclusive result with the ultrasound, we should choose the ultrasound, otherwise the MRI directly.
		- But what if we do not know or cannot quantify these (at zero cost)? — I would say: [[try easier]]
			- Also, knowing usually pays off, and not knowing is just a byproduct of [[underthinking]], and as a result you will end up trying harder. Sometimes you have to think hard to try easier.
		- However, if trying with the ultrasound and then the MRI results in a similar cost/benefit (or exactly the same cost/utility as in the diagram), but the MRI is just faster (being a guaranteed one step process, i.e., no longer [[ceteris paribus]], we now have different time cost too), then [[succeed fast]]
