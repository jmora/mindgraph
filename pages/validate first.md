- Principle for avoiding [[risk]], especially [[catastrophic failure]] risk
- Some people refer to it as "fail fast" (but some people mean entirely different things with "fail fast")
- [[Agile]] validates through working software which may be a working prototype
	- Note: there may be cheaper and better ways to validate
- Test your hypotheses with a tool for that, e.g. an  [[MVP]], or a working theoretical model
  * De-risk the project first, using the least amount of resources, especially time
  * Prioritise the biggest risks, i.e. those most likely to materialise, and most likely to require pivoting
- Using the least amount of resources to eliminate or address the greatest possible risks allows the use of resources to pivot when that is the best approach to address a risk (e.g. the risk materialises)
