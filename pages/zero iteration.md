- You may consider it a creative constraint. Core idea:
	- Nothing is perfect, everything may be improved, iterating is always an option.
	- But if something is good enough to be [an asset rather than a liability]([[asset-liability duality]]), it may be good enough to move to the next thing, and that may be achievable through zero iteration (at a given scale or granularity, given enough previous practice, etc.)
	- The point is not iterating until reaching [[diminishing returns]], but iterating the least possible to reach something good enough, and then working on something else, where the returns are greater.
	- With this approach, we are considering the [[opportunity cost]] of iterating on something, against the option of moving to the next thing.
- With respect to previous practice: it may be considered iteration, at a higher (granularity) level, e.g.: “I am not iterating on the requirements extraction step for this project, I have done many projects before, and I have extracted requirements many times before.” Related: [[embrace change]].
